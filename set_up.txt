Set up for two LED strip lights and two feeders

• Raspberry Pi 4 GPIO Assignments and connections for automated chamber

    ○ FEEDER 1 connections
        GPIO 25 (pin22) -> yellow servo motor cable (servo control signal line cable)
        5V power (pin2) -> red servo motor cable (servo power cable, the battery positive terminal)
        Ground (pin30) -> brown servo motor cable (battery negative terminal cable) to a ground source on RPI 
        
    ○ FEEDER 2 connections
        GPIO 25 (pin22) -> yellow servo motor cable (servo control signal line cable)
        5V power (pin2) -> red servo motor cable (servo power cable, the battery positive terminal)
        Ground (pin30) -> brown servo motor cable (battery negative terminal cable) to a ground source on RPI
    
• LIGHTS
   
   • connecting 12V power supply source to breadboard to supply appropriate voltage to LED lights.
      - using a female adapter, get two jumper wires to power the breadboard:
      -> red to + line
      -> black to - line
  
   ○  LIGHTS 1
      • connecting the black cable from LED lights to the + line at the top of our board
          -> connect with a male-male jumper cable (I used a white one to make it easier to see)
          
      • place mosfets on board, positioned like in the picture provided in picture_file
      • connect cable of GPIO output from Rpi to the leftmost connection out of the 3 for the mosfet
      • connect red/green or blue cable from LED to the middle connection out of the 3 for the mosfet
      • last connection out of the 3 for the mosfet: the mini cable from (-negative) blue line in the board to mosfet 


• GPIO Assignments for LIGHTS 1:
     red  = GPIO 17 (pin11)
     green  = GPIO 22 (pin15)
     blue  = GPIO 24 (pin18)

   ○  LIGHTS 2
      • same method as for LIGHTS 1
      • connect black cable from led to + line on breadboard
      
• GPIO Assignments for LIGHTS 2
   red  = GPIO 5 (pin29)
   green  = GPIO 6 (pin31)
   blue  = GPIO 16 (pin36)


# to control lights on terminal:
    > sudo pigpiod
    > pigs p GPIO_number intensity 

      # example: to set red lights to max intensity
        > sudo pigpiod
        > pigs p 17 255
